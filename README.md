# fixed-sidebar
- On many websites we can find the sidebar shorter than the content so when we scroll to bottom we will find an empty space beside the content, So here I worked on this to make the sidebar fixed on scroll if its height shorter than the page. If it's height is greater than the screen it will be scrollable to show all of its content but will be also fixed when we reach its end.

- I just used JQuery library, no more dependencies
